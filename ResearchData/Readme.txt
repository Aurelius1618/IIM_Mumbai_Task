The research data contains six data files:

1. Demand_Distribution.csv:
This data table records the customer demand distribution and is used for all computational experiments. 

2. CandidateSet_Full.csv:
This data table records the full set of facility candidates.

3. TrainingTable.csv:
This data table records the research data for the ANN model training and evaluation.


The following data tables are used for the numerical experiments in Section 6.2 of this paper.

4. Candidate_set_VP_50_VQ_500.csv:
This data table records the instances for the computational experiments. The sizes of the primary and secondary facility candidates are set to 50 and 500, respectively (|VP|=50 and |VQ|=500).

5. Candidate_set_VP_80_VQ_800.csv:
This data table records the instances for the computational experiments. The sizes of the primary and secondary facility candidates are set to 80 and 800, respectively (|VP|=80 and |VQ|=800).

6. Candidate_set_VP_100_VQ_1000.csv:
This data table records the instances for the computational experiments. The sizes of the primary and secondary facility candidates are set to 100 and 1000, respectively (|VP|=100 and |VQ|=1000).
